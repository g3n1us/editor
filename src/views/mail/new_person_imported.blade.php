Welcome to Arlington Science Focus School! 

As part of joining the ASFS community, you are invited to register for our school's PTA website and directory. The PTA website serves as the central location for all important school PTA news, events, and key information. In addition, the PTA Directory provides the primary source for all PTA communications and the main way for parents to connect with one another.


Follow these steps to register today:
1. Bookmark the ASFS PTA website: https://www.asfspta.com
2. Visit https://www.asfspta.com and click the 'Register' button on the top right.
3. Register for the ASFS PTA website by completing the required fields. Once you submit your information and confirm your email address, you will receive an email once your account has been approved and activated.

Once you login to the PTA website, visit the Dashboard to update your personal and family information. Note: Changing your information in the ASFS PTA Directory will NOT change your information within the APS school system. This must be changed in ParentVUE(https://vue.apsva.us/Login_pxp.aspx). 

You do have the option to opt out of any information that you would prefer not to be displayed in the ASFS PTA Directory. To update your preferences, visit the Dashboard and click on Opt Out for you and your family members to make any changes. 

Important Note: The ASFS PTA Directory is the primary way parents may connect with one another. All PTA communications, including the weekly electronic newsletter and important PTA announcements, as well as room parent emails, class birthday party invites, and requests for playdates from other ASFS parents rely on having your email address included in the ASFS PTA Directory.

Questions? Contact ASFS PTA Directory leads Anna Whitehead (artw80@gmail.com) or Amanda Agetstein (amanda.agetstein@gmail.com).
